# Sector Analysis for Renaissance Stock Ranking System

## Overview

The sector analysis component enhances the Renaissance Stock Ranking System by providing sector-based insights derived from the individual stock rankings. While the core system ranks stocks based on yearly returns, this module adds another dimension by analyzing performance, concentration, and financial metrics at the sector level.

This additional perspective enables portfolio managers to:

- Identify outperforming and underperforming sectors
- Understand sector dynamics and trends
- Make informed sector allocation decisions
- Find top-performing stocks within specific sectors
- Balance sector exposure for optimal diversification

```

This will:
1. Load the latest ranking results from `output/NIFTY500_Rankings_*.csv`
2. Load the financial metrics from `data/financial_metrics.csv` (optional)
3. Load the NIFTY 500 list with sector information from `data/nifty500_list.csv`
4. Generate sector analysis reports in `output/sector_analysis/`

### Command-Line Options

For customization, use the following options:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_sectors.py --help
```

Common options:
- `--rankings-file`: Path to the rankings CSV file
- `--metrics-file`: Path to the financial metrics CSV file
- `--nifty500-file`: Path to the NIFTY 500 list CSV file with sector information
- `--output-dir`: Directory to save sector analysis outputs
- `--visualization`: Whether to generate visualizations (default: True)

### Integration with Main Workflow

Typically, sector analysis is run after the core ranking process:

```bash
# 1. Run the core ranking system
python scripts/run_ranking.py

# 2. Generate visualizations
python scripts/visualize_results.py

# 3. Perform sector analysis
python scripts/analyze_sectors.py
```

## Interpretation Guide

### Sector Performance Analysis

The sector performance analysis helps answer these key questions:

1. **Which sectors are outperforming?**
   - Look for sectors with high average yearly returns
   - Pay attention to sectors with low rank numbers (closer to 1)
   - Consider the rank percentile (lower percentile = better performance)

2. **How consistent is sector performance?**
   - Check the standard deviation of returns within each sector
   - Compare median return to mean return (large differences indicate outliers)
   - Look at the min/max spread to understand the range of performance

3. **Which sectors offer the best risk-adjusted returns?**
   - Calculate return-to-volatility ratio (mean return / standard deviation)
   - Sectors with high returns and low standard deviation offer better risk-adjusted performance

### Sector Concentration Analysis

The concentration analysis helps understand:

1. **Portfolio diversification**
   - Is the index heavily concentrated in a few sectors?
   - Are certain sectors significantly underrepresented?

2. **Sector bias**
   - Does the NIFTY 500 have structural biases toward certain sectors?
   - How does the sector distribution compare to the overall economy?

3. **Investment implications**
   - Sectors with high concentration may have more impact on overall market movements
   - Underrepresented sectors might offer unique diversification benefits

### Top Stocks By Sector Analysis

This analysis helps:

1. **Identify sector leaders**
   - Which stocks are consistently outperforming within their sectors?
   - Do certain sectors have more standout performers than others?

2. **Compare financial characteristics**
   - How do top performers' financial metrics compare to sector averages?
   - Are there patterns in the financial profiles of sector leaders?

3. **Find value opportunities**
   - Look for stocks with strong performance but below-average valuations
   - Identify sectors where top performers still have reasonable valuations

## Advanced Applications

### Sector Rotation Strategy

The sector analysis can be used to implement a sector rotation strategy:

1. **Overweight outperforming sectors**
   - Allocate more capital to sectors with strong recent performance
   - Focus on sectors with improving rankings

2. **Identify sector trends**
   - Monitor changes in sector performance over time
   - Look for emerging sector leadership

3. **Tactical allocation**
   - Adjust sector weights based on performance momentum
   - Consider economic cycle positioning when interpreting sector performance

### Relative Value Analysis

Use the financial metrics comparison to:

1. **Identify relatively undervalued sectors**
   - Compare PE ratios, PB ratios across sectors
   - Consider historical valuation ranges for each sector

2. **Find mispriced stocks within sectors**
   - Look for stocks trading at discounts to sector averages
   - Compare stock metrics to sector medians rather than means (reduces outlier impact)

3. **Develop sector-specific screening criteria**
   - Different sectors have different "normal" valuation ranges
   - Set sector-specific thresholds for financial metrics

### Risk Management Applications

Sector analysis improves risk management by:

1. **Monitoring sector concentration**
   - Avoid excessive exposure to any single sector
   - Maintain balanced sector allocations

2. **Understanding correlations**
   - Certain sectors are more correlated than others
   - Diversify across less-correlated sectors

3. **Anticipating sector-specific risks**
   - Regulatory changes often affect entire sectors
   - Economic shifts impact different sectors differently
